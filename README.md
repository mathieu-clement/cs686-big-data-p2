# Project 2 - Spatiotemporal Analysis with MapReduce

This repository includes starter files and a sample directory structure. You are welcome to use it or come up with your own project structure.

Project Specification: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~mmalensek/courses/cs686/projects/project-2.html

# Deliverables

The project specification defines several questions that you will answer with MapReduce jobs. You should edit this document (README.md) with your answers as you find them, including figures, references, etc. This will also serve as a way of tracking your progress through the milestones.

## Deliverable I

#### How many records are in the dataset?

The program outputs: `<records, 323759744>`

We can compare this to the number of records that we see in the statistics at the end of the job: 

    Map-Reduce Framework
        Map input records=323759744
        Map output records=323759744
        Combine input records=323759744
